AirplaneFlightDatabase
======================

A PHP site that allows customers to query and select a database for airplane flights. Admins can modify the database directly.

The files uploaded here are incomplete - there is a file that contains the connection information (the username and password) to access the database. This has not been uploaded for obvious reasons. :)
